Smart City Multi-Agent Traffic Optimization

Description:

This Git repository hosts a multi-agent system designed to simulate and optimize the operation of a smart city's road network. The project encompasses various key features and functionalities, including:

Road Network Simulation: Creation of a comprehensive road network, complete with buildings, vehicles, and traffic regulators (traffic lights).
Traffic Flow Optimization: Intelligent control of traffic lights throughout the city to enhance traffic flow efficiency.
Emergency Response Units: Integration of emergency response units such as ambulances, police, and fire engines, prioritizing their movement above regular vehicles.
Dynamic Priority Assignment: Assignment of priority levels to emergency units based on their urgency, ensuring the highest priority to those with the most critical tasks.
Scenario Handling: Management of diverse scenarios, including handling robberies, fires, and emergency hospital transports, adapting traffic flow accordingly.
Statistical Monitoring: Implementation of statistical monitoring of vehicle movements and their arrival times at designated destinations.



The figure below shows the classes of the system and the connections between them.
